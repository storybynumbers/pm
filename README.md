# Project Process Templates

A set of templates for running smarter, calmer projects — made with care by [Story by Numbers](https://storybynumbers.com).

## Overview

Every project deserves a strong start, a steady rhythm, and a sharp memory. This collection of markdown-based templates is designed to help you build all three, with structured sections and embedded AI prompts to keep your work consistent, thoughtful, and clear.

## Repository Structure

The templates are organized into three main categories:

### 1. Project start (01-initiation/)

Templates for starting new projects:

- **Discovery** (`discovery.md`): Captures key thinking needed to move from idea → scoping → budgeting. Defines the problem, opportunity, users, constraints, and technical realities.
- **Kickoff** (`kickoff.md`): Establishes mission, goals, and working agreements for the project.

### 2. Cycle Management (02-cycle/)

Templates for ongoing project management:

- **Cycle Update** (`cycle_update.md`): 6-week summary of achievements, challenges, and priorities for the next cycle.
- **Ticket** (`ticket.md`): Structured format for creating clear, outcome-driven task tickets.
- **Weekly Update** (`weekly_update.md`): Weekly progress report including completed work, metrics, risks, and next week's goals.

### 3. Context (03-context/)

Templates for maintaining project context:

- **Knowledge File** (`knowledge_file.md`): Living strategic blueprint that connects the concept of the work to its realization. Includes an AI Context Pack for prompt injection.

## How to Use

1. **Choose the appropriate template** based on your current project phase or documentation need.
2. **Copy the template** to your project repository or documentation system.
3. **Fill in the sections** with your project-specific information.
4. **Use the embedded prompts** (found at the bottom of most templates) to generate content with AI assistance.

## Embedded AI Prompts

Most templates include an embedded prompt section that can be used with AI tools to generate content. These prompts are designed to:

- Provide context about the project
- Define the audience and purpose
- Specify the tone and focus
- Guide the AI to produce relevant, high-quality content

Simply copy the prompt text and use it with your preferred AI assistant to generate a draft, then refine as needed.
